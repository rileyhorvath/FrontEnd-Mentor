            <img src="images/image-daniel.jpg"><p>Daniel Clifford<br><span>Verified Graduate</span></p>
          </div>
          <div class="intro"> I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, 
            in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny‚Äôs worth.</div>
          <div class="content">‚Äú I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I‚Äôve been looking to make a 
            transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up 
            for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
            The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing 
            the course, I‚Äôve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ‚Äù</div>
      </div>
      <div class="card two">
        <div class="title">
          <img src="images/image-jonathan.jpg"><p>Jonathan Walters<br><span>Verified Graduate</span></p>
        </div>
        <div class="intro">  The team was very supportive and kept me motivated
        </div>
        <div class="content">‚Äú I started as a total newbie with virtually no coding skills. I now work as a mobile engineer 
          for a big company. This was one of the best investments I‚Äôve made in myself. ‚Äù</div>
      </div>
      <div class="card three">
        <div class="title">
          <img src="images/image-kira.jpg"><p>Kira Whittle<br><span class="black">Verified Graduate</span></p>
        </div>
        <div class="intro">Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!
        </div>
        <div class="content black">‚Äú Before joining the bootcamp, I‚Äôve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from 
          professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former 
          student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff 
          did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team 
          project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial 
          could ever have. In fact, I‚Äôve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent 
          experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 
          100% recommend! ‚Äù</div>
      </div>
      <div class="card four">
        <div class="title">
          <img src="images/image-jeanette.jpg"><p>Jeanette Harmon<br><span class="black">Verified Graduate</span></p>
        </div>
        <div class="intro">An overall wonderful and rewarding experience</div>
        <div class="content black"><p style="font-size:14pt;">" Thank you for the wonderful experience! I now have a job I really enjoy, 
          and make a good living while doing something I love."</p></div>
      </div>
      <div class="card five">
        <div class="title">
          <img src="images/image-patrick.jpg"><p>Patrick Abrams<br><span>Verified Graduate</span></p>
        </div>
        <div class="intro">Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and 
          learning from their experiences was easy.</div>
        <div class="content"><p style="font-size:14pt;">‚Äú The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. 
          The program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself 
          as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal 
          attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ‚Äù</p></div>
